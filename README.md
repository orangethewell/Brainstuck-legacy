# brainfuck-interpreter
This is just another brainfuck interpreter implemented in C. But will be something a little more interessing in the future! Maybe...

## How to use
Just compile an executable in your PC with `make` and execute your brainfuck code with:

```
brainstruck my_delicious_code.bf
```
